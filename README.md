Game engine experiment with Three.js to implement different kind of controls for a 3rd person character.

This has to be hosted to be ran because it uses javascript modules.
Will host it soon. In the meantime you can simply run `python3 -m http.server` at the root directory and open http://localhost:8000/main.html in your browser.
